*Thank you for your help!*

## Quick Start Guide:
1. Clone into the repo and save the folder in an accessible location on your computer. Do not use a codespace.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and click on the toggle for developer mode (top right corner)
3. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the entire folder you saved in step 1.
4. Login to workday course listings page for the current semester and click the extensions tab --> WorkdayCourseFormatter, the popup should appear.
5. When you make changes to the code make sure to save the changed files, then in the extensions tab (chrome://extensions/) click on the reload button for the extension to apply the changes

## Clean Coding Notes:
- Please DO NOT commit to main. Work from the dev branch and start a new branch for every feature update/patch you add. When an addition is complete and code is working stably do a final commit and open a pull request.
> For example if I wanted to add the Professor to the course info I would start a new branch off of dev called "addProf", then make my changes so it was working with this addition, then commit changes and open a pull request to merge changes into dev branch.
- Remember to git pull before starting on something new and git push periodically!

## Todo List:
Please check out the todo list in the projects tab! When you start working on something make sure to assign yourself and move to the "working on" bucket. Some tasks are marked **urgent** these should be prioritized for work becuase they are needed by other additions in the queue.
